# Primitives and Objects

## Primitives
* int 4 bytes
* char 1 byte
* long 8 bytes
* float 4 bytes
* double 8 bytes
* Boolean 1 byte

## Objects
* String
* Integer

## Difference between primitives and objects (In Java)
* Objects automatically choose the length of storage.
* Objects have methods to be called.


# Relationship between classes and UML diagrams

## Relationships
### Association
* a line
### Generalization / inheritance
* an solid line with triangular arrow
### Implimentation (from a interface)
* dotted lined with triangular arrow
### Dependence
* dotted line with acute arrow

## Goals for UML diagram
* Minimize dependencies
More dependence means more complexity; more complexity means more possible errors generated from other classes.
It also means more difficulty to maintain.

## Notes:
* This is UML class diagram, so there is no instantiation in it.
