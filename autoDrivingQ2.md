# 2018 IB CS Case Study: Automonous Driving. Question 2


## 1) what does the question mean?

Fairly simple. The question just means what it means. 

Explanations for VTV, VTI, and CNN may facilitates question understanding.

VTV stands for vehicle to vehicle, and is a protocal for information transfer between vehicles. Similarly, VTI, vehicle to infrastructure, is another protocal for information transfer between vehicles and infrastructures related to roads. CNN, convolutional neural networks, is a type of neural network that guides how the car moves.

## 2) why was that question chosen? (What is the rationale or connection to the case study?)

The topic discussed is related to some of the concepts and decisions in the case study. The examiner wants to check our understanding towards them.

## 3) what is the answer to that question?

### (a)

VTV facilitates communication between vehicles, talking about their speed, location, direction of travel, braking, and loss of stability. This helps vehicle's route choosing, speed control, safety control, emergency management and etc..

VTI provides communication between vehicles and overhead RFID readers and cameras, traffic lights, lane markers, streetlights, signage and parking meters. It enables vehicles to report road information to the passangers, and report massive vehicles information to the infrastructure to facilitate traffic management.

In a autonomous car only city, communnication would be extremely powerful, because traffic information is totally shared. Route selection and other kinds of NN calculations would be greatly facilitated.

### (b)


# 4) what is a question for this yearâ€™s case study that uses the same why (rationale or connection)?
